# Welcome to the Open Micro Front End Platform (OpenMFP) Project on GitHub

:wave: Welcome to the official GitHub presence of OpenMFP. We are part of [ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/content/projects/) which is an Important Project of Common European Interest - Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS). We contribute to ApeiroRA's core aim of creating an overarching multi-provider cloud-edge continuum by bringing
together micro front ends and APIs into a cohesive platform, allowing teams to contribute components while maintaining their independence. 

## :globe_with_meridians: ApeiroRA?

ApeiroRA is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request and consume services, and for service providers to describe, offer and provision their services.

By being open source, ApeiroRA provides a cross-border spillover effect, solidifying the foundation and future of the project.

## :handshake: OpenMFP and ApeiroRA

OpenMFP extends ApeiroRA's Platform Mesh principles to frontend development, creating a unified interface that evolves automatically with the underlying infrastructure. This is facilitated through the management of
of [Micro Frontends](https://www.turing.com/blog/micro-frontends-what-are-they-when-to-use-them), a compartmentalized approach to front end development.

## :penguin: Features

- **Decoupled Development:** Teams can work independently using their preferred technologies, promoting agility and innovation while contributing to shared objectives.
- **Unified User Experience:**  integrates key systems like authentication, reducing redundancy and improving usability across services.
- **Extension Mechanism:** The platform supports adding new micro front ends and APIs, ensuring scalability and adaptability to evolving needs.
