The Open Micro Frontend Platform (OpenMFP) project is an opinionated, “batteries-included” framework for building portals and complex web based applications with enterprise qualities.

Key value propositions are the dynamic extension model and the inclusion of central shared services (e.g. for Authorization), which enable the seamless integration of capabilities from different teams, organizations or vendors, while preserving full autonomy when it comes to choice of technology and owning the component life cycle.
